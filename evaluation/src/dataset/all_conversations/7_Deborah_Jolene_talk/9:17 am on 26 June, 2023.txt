Deborah: Hey Jolene! How's it going? We haven't talked in a while. I've been busy getting ready for a yoga retreat with some buddies. A chance to hang out with people who think like me and find peace and understanding. Sounds awesome!
Jolene: Hey Deb! Been super hectic with internship and stuff. That retreat sounds awesome, I could definitely use a break!
Deborah: By the way, I tried a new pose - Dancer Pose (Natarajasana). Rate, did I succeed?
Jolene: You are amazing as always! Here are new photos of Seraphim in the new aquarium that I bought the day before yesterday.
Deborah: Where'd you get it? I'm always drawn to animals, they bring so much joy. What's its story?
Jolene:  I got her last year, she's a great pet. She always cheers me up and brings a sense of peace. Spending time with her is so comforting.
Deborah: Pets really do make life more enjoyable and bright. 
Jolene:  I'm so thankful it's here. Plus, it's nice to have a calm creature around.
Deborah: How have things been besides that?
Jolene: Things have been intense lately. I'm really pushing myself to succeed, and sometimes it feels overwhelming. But I'm determined to overcome any obstacles and achieve my goals.
Deborah: Keep up the hard work and remember to relax too.
Jolene: Thanks, Deborah! I had a big breakthrough with this project - so exciting and rewarding!
Deborah: Awesome, Jolene! I'm really glad your project worked out. 
Jolene: Stop talking about me, tell me more about your retreat.
Deborah: I'd rather show you a photo. This is also a new yoga pose that we tried. It is a tree pose.
Jolene: What's that statue in the picture?
Deborah: It's a symbol of peace and enlightenment.
Jolene: Wow, it looks gorgeous! I'd love to visit a retreat like that. It seems like the ideal spot to find peace and refreshment.
Deborah: It's perfect for reflecting and getting centered.
Jolene: I could really use some chill time like that. Sounds so peaceful.
Deborah: Yeah, we all need some peaceful time to relax.
Jolene: Gotta run, have a nice day!
Deborah: See you!
