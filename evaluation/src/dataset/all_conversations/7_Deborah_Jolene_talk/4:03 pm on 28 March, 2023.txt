Jolene: Hey Deb, long time no talk. A lot's happened! On Friday I had a breakthrough with my engineering project. Finally found a solution to a prob that's been bugging me. Feels great to see my hard work paying off.
Deborah: You've really proven your skills. Feels great, right? Keep it up! And I bought new props for the yoga class! Here it is in action.
Jolene: Oh, I also have new details for this case! Rate it!
Deborah: That`s cool! I also bought this candle for the atmosphere and to improve my yoga practice. How about you? When you do it, what feelings do you get?
Jolene: I feel relaxed during this activity. I love creating a serene space with soothing scents like lavender and rosemary. Do you have any favorite scents or rituals for when you do it?
Deborah: I'm also a big fan of scents like this! Candles and essential oils add warmth and calm to my yoga session. It's amazing how certain smells can transport you to a place of peace.  Do you have any other ways to enhance your yoga practice?
Jolene: I find music helps me. Any favorite tracks?
Deborah: I find instrumental tracks with mellow melodies and rhythms help create a peaceful vibe. One of my favorites is a track called "Savana." What songs/artists do you like listening to during your practice?
Jolene: I love listening to Nils Frahm and Olafur Arnalds during my practice. Their music is so calming and puts me in a different headspace. Do you have any recommendations for other similar artists or tracks I should check out?
Deborah: Also, I'm listening to an album called 'Sleep,' which is great for meditation and deep relaxation. Hope you find it as calming as I do!
Jolene: Thanks for the tips, Deborah! I'm gonna check them out. It's always good to have some new tunes for yoga!
Deborah:  Let me know your thoughts on the albums!
Jolene: See you!
Deborah: Take care and keep up the good work!
