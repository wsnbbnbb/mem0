Jolene: Hey Deborah, totally buzzing! Had a great night out last night - dinner, and drinks with my friends. So glad I got to let my hair down. You?
Deborah: Sounds great, Jolene! I just visited this place and it was so calming. Nostalgic too.
Jolene: Wow, those flowers are beautiful! What type are they? It looks so peaceful there.
Deborah: The roses and dahlias bring me peace. I lost a friend last week, so I've been spending time in the garden to find some comfort.
Jolene: Sorry to hear about your friend, Deb. Losing someone can be really tough. How are you holding up?
Deborah: Thanks for the kind words. It's been tough, but I'm comforted by remembering our time together. It reminds me of how special life is.
Jolene: Memories can give us so much comfort and joy.
Deborah: Memories keep our loved ones close. This is the last photo with Karlie which was taken last summer when we hiked. It was our last one. We had such a great time! Every time I see it, I can't help but smile.
Jolene: Wow, looks like a great trip! Where else have you traveled?
Deborah: I've been blessed to travel to a few places and Bali last year was one of my favs. It was a gorgeous island that gave me peace, great for yoga.
Jolene: Wow, that's great! Is yoga on the beach a thing? I've been wanting to try it.
Deborah: The sound of the waves and the fresh air is wonderful!
Jolene: I'll definitely give it a go! It sounds peaceful. Thanks!
Deborah: Let me know how it goes. Enjoy it!
Jolene: I'll keep you posted if I decide to go there.
Deborah: Take care!
