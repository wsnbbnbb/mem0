Jolene: Hi Deb! How're you? I've been busy. My engineering professor gave us a huge robotics project. It's tough but fun, it's making me get creative and problem-solve.
Deborah: Hey Jolene! It's great to hear from you. It sounds challenging but interesting! It must be really putting your creative and problem-solving skills to the test. How did you feel when you first received the project? Are you enjoying working on it?
Jolene: When I got it, I felt a mix of emotions - excited and nervous. But now, I'm really enjoying it! It's like trying to solve a puzzle, figuring out the best design and programming. Seeing the robot come together is awesome too!
Deborah: That's awesome, Jolene! You're enjoying the process. It must be really satisfying to see it come together. Keep up the good work! Oh, by the way, I met my new neighbor Anna yesterday!
Jolene: How did you two meet?
Deborah: It happened at yoga in the park.
Jolene: Wow, that's awesome! It's great connecting with people who have similar interests. Did you two talk about it?
Deborah: Yeah, we talked about how it has improved our lives and the sense of community it gives.
Jolene: Sounds great!
Deborah: Have you ever thought about resuming yoga?
Jolene: Well... we planned to play the console with my partner.
Deborah: It's also good that you have something to do together.
Jolene: Thanks for the kind words!
Deborah: Gotta run bye!
Jolene: See you soon!
