Deborah: Hey Jolene, I'm so excited to tell you! Yesterday, me and my neighbor ran a free gardening class for the community, it was awesome! People of any age joined in and it was such a great thing to see.
Jolene: Wow, Deborah, that's awesome! Keep up the great work, and here's hoping for more events like this in the future!
Deborah:  Gardening is really amazing. It brings us together in such a cool way. It was awesome to share my love of plants and help people take care of the world. So, what about you? Anything new happened lately?
Jolene: We tried a scuba diving lesson last Friday and had an awesome time! We found a cool dive spot we can explore together. Trying new things opens up a world of adventure - maybe one day I'll be a certified diver. Anything fun going on with you?
Deborah: That sounds amazing, Jolene! I've been interested in underwater life, but I haven't had the chance to try scuba diving yet. Recently, I've been spending time remembering my mom. Last Sunday, I visited her old house and sat on a bench. It was a comforting experience, as if I could feel her presence guide me and remind me of her love.
Jolene: Visiting your mom's old home sounds like it was really special. Is there something special you remember about her?
Deborah: Thanks, Jolene! It was really special. My mom had a big passion for cooking. She would make amazing meals for us, each one full of love and warmth. I can still remember the smell of her special dish, it would fill the house and bring us all together.
Jolene: Mmm, that looks delicious, Deb! So sweet how cooking with your mom brought everyone together. What's your best memory of cooking with her?
Deborah: I loved it when she would bake pineapple birthday cakes for me when I was a kid. It always made me feel so special.
Jolene: No wonder it made you feel special. 
Deborah: Have you ever had something like that with someone close?
Jolene: I used to bake cookies with someone close to me.
Deborah: What's your favorite cookie to make?
Jolene: The warm, gooey chocolate and soft, buttery cookie are a match made in heaven.
Deborah: I really want to eat this now.
Jolene: Well look what I have here!
Deborah:  Is there anything special about it or the photo?
Jolene: It takes me to another world when I read it!
Deborah: Did I show you that I have a big bookshelf too?
Jolene: I think not, I really like it!
Deborah: Having a space like this is important for escaping reality and relaxing with a book. Do you have any books that really moved you?
Jolene: My bathroom has an aesthetic vibe. Once I read a self-discovery book there and it really resonated with me.
Deborah: Wow! A special book that speaks to you and helps with self-discovery? That's awesome. Plus, having a cozy nook to chill? That's my best one!
Jolene: Sounds nice, Deb! A cozy nook is a must! The beach is a great place for finding peace and relaxation. Have you ever tried surfing?
Deborah: Certainly! Here's the confirmation.
Jolene: How cool! But I never decided to try it.
Deborah: It's okay, maybe we can try it together sometime!
Jolene: I already know what fate awaits me if I do this!
Deborah: Have you ever been interested in this or do you know nothing about it?
Jolene: Just started learning, but haven't gone yet. Want to come with me sometime?
Deborah: It'll be an adventure! Let's make it happen soon!
Jolene: So glad, all that remains is to agree and choose the right time for both of us.
Deborah:  Can't wait. What day works for you? I'm really excited!
Jolene: Let's plan for next month - I'll check my schedule and let you know. Can't wait!
