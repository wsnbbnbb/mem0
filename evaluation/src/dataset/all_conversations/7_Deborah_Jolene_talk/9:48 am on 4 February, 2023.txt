Jolene: Hey Deborah! Good to hear from you. How've you been? I've been on an emotional rollercoaster lately, but I'm coping.
Deborah: Hey Jolene! Good to hear from you. All good here - how about you? Anything new happening lately?
Jolene: I had a major milestone last week and it went really well - I'm so relieved and proud. It was a huge accomplishment for me as an engineer.
Deborah: That's awesome. You must have worked really hard for that. I'm so proud of you. Care to share more about it?
Jolene: Thanks so much! I had to plan and research a lot to design and build a sustainable water purifier for a rural community in need. It was tough, but I loved the experience.
Deborah: Your engineering skills really made a difference for people in a rural area. That's amazing! How did it feel when you saw it working?
Jolene: It was such a surreal moment. Seeing it working and providing clean water to the community was incredibly satisfying. It reminded me of how engineering can make a difference in people's lives. It made me feel like I had a purpose and had done something good.
Deborah: So, what are your career aspirations now?
Jolene:  I want to keep working in engineering and continue to make a positive impact on communities in need by creating sustainable solutions. My goal is to contribute towards making the world a better place with my work.
Deborah:  I'm sure great things will keep coming your way. Keep up the good work and follow your passions!
Jolene: Your support means a lot. I'm determined to keep going and make a difference. Your encouragement really motivates me to pursue my passions.
Deborah: When things get tough, just take a deep breath and remember why you're doing this. This is where I spend a lot of my time, teaching yoga. It's a great way to find balance and reconnect with ourselves. I bonded with Anna during yesterday's l yoga class.
Jolene: Wow, that's awesome! What new poses did you try?
Deborah: We were trying out different dance poses, like Warrior II, which builds strength and boosts focus.
Jolene: Is it difficult to do?
Deborah: Yes, but this brought us closer to Anna! We supported each other, that means a lot.
Jolene: Can you explain how to do it?
Deborah: Sure! To do this modified pose, sit on the edge of a chair with your feet planted. Twist your torso to one side and use your hand on your knee for support. You'll feel a stretch in your back and shoulders as you hold it for a few breaths, then switch sides. It's great for relaxing tense muscles.
Jolene: Sounds really hard! Here's my bookshelf!
Deborah: That's quite a collection! Have you had a favorite book lately? I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Jolene: Thanks Deborah! I'm really into this book called "Sapiens" - it's a fascinating look at human history and how technology has affected us. It's giving me a lot to think about!
Deborah: Great, this is interesting! Have you come across any recent ones that really struck you?
Jolene: Two weeks ago I read "Avalanche" by Neal Stephenson in one sitting! 
Deborah: That sounds cool, Jolene. Stories can be so powerful - they can teach us, motivate us, and bring us together. 
Jolene: I also read a recent story about someone who became successful despite facing numerous challenges. It really showed me that anything is possible if you believe and work hard.
Deborah: That's a really powerful message. It reminds me of someone special and their grace and strength when they faced hardships. Check out this creation!
Jolene: Wow, Deb! That's beautiful! Can you tell me the backstory of that bouquet?
Deborah: My friend gave me this bouquet when I was struggling, and it gives me hope and courage. I'm filled with warmth and appreciation when I look at it.
Jolene: That's really sweet. Such a small thing can make a real difference.
Deborah: It's amazing how something as simple as flowers can make a real difference. Nature sure is beautiful.
Jolene: Where are some of your favorite nature spots?
Deborah: Oh, there's so many great places! My favorite is a park with a forest trail - it's so calming getting lost in nature. Then there's this beach nearby that I love - the sound of the waves and the sand under my feet make me feel all peaceful and happy. Do you have any favorite spots, Jolene?
Jolene: Here's a picture I took on vacation last summer in Bogota. It was so beautiful and calming watching the sunset over the water. It definitely made me appreciate nature's calming power.
Deborah: That sounds great, Jolene. Nature's calming for sure. Guess it helps us forget the daily craziness and find inner peace. No wonder you're a fan! I like to come to this spot by the water near my mom's old house. It's where I reflect on her life and find some peace. Being surrounded by nature helps a lot.
Jolene: That's so touching! Do you have any little traditions that you do when you come to reflect on your mom?
Deborah: Do you remember this amulet from her? Whenever I come here, I bring it with me. It's how I feel her love and stay close to her. Holding it brings me comfort.
Jolene: It's amazing how something so small can have such a big impact, huh?
Deborah: Yeah, even small things like this can make a big difference. It's a reminder of all the love and strength we have inside, connecting us to people we've lost and comforting us.
Jolene: It can keep them close in our hearts every day.
Deborah: Anna also has a pendant that she wears in memory of her mother! This also brought us closer.
Jolene: It's nice to have those reminders as a source of strength when we need it.
Deborah: Life's tough but hang in there. Look to your sources of strength and you'll do great. Stay in touch, take care of yourself, and know I'm always here to cheer you on!
Jolene: Thanks, Deb! Your encouragement means a lot to me. I'll definitely stay in touch. Bye, take care and keep shining!
Deborah: Stay safe!  Bye!
