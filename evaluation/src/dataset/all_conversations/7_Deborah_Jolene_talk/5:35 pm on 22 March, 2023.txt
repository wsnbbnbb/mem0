Deborah: Hey Jolene, it's been a while. Hope you're doing okay with all your exams and deadlines. I know it's difficult for you right now.
Jolene: Hey Deb! Yeah, it can be tough. Trying to find time for everything is like playing catch-up - really stressful!
Deborah:  How do you manage your time and stay organized with all the projects and deadlines?
Jolene: I'm using the Pomodoro Technique - 25 minutes work, 5-minute break - to avoid burnout but I'm still struggling to prioritize. Do you have any other tips on time management?
Deborah: I create a daily schedule or to-do list. Here's my example for today.
Jolene: I tried making one but it's kinda overwhelming when it's a big stack of tasks. Here's an example from last Friday.
Deborah: Have you tried breaking it down or prioritizing the tasks?
Jolene: It can often feel overwhelming and difficult to figure out where to start.
Deborah: I get it, Jolene. When I'm overloaded, I use a certain method. It helps me figure out what's important and urgent so I'm more organized. Do you know about it?
Jolene: Nah, I'm not familiar with that one. What's it about?
Deborah: Want me to tell you about it? It helps you organize things based on how important and urgent they are.
Jolene: Sure, tell me more about it! It sounds useful.
Deborah: The Eisenhower Matrix sorts tasks into four boxes, categorizing them based on their urgency and importance. It can be really useful for organizing and prioritizing. Here's a breakdown. 
Jolene: The visualization is helpful too. Thanks for sharing!
Deborah: I am glad, it was helpful. Let's give it a try and see if it helps you stay focused and less stressed. 
Jolene: Yeah, I'll give it a go. Fingers crossed it'll help me. Thanks for the help!
Deborah: Don't forget to take it easy and look after yourself. Wishing you all the best! Recently, Anna and I were sitting by the sea, watching the sunset and talking about each other. And we realized that we inspire each other. What thoughts does the sea in this photo make you think of?
Jolene: This gets me thinking of when I'll learn to surf. Gotta find that spare time!
Deborah: Surfing, huh Jolene? Chase your dreams, don't be daunted. Have you thought about the steps you can take?
Jolene: Definitely! I've been gathering information, watching videos, and I even got a beginners' guide to surfing. Just need to find the right time and place to get a lesson.
Deborah: Way to go! Taking those first steps is key. Believe in yourself and keep going!
Jolene: Thanks for the support! Those got me pumped to try surfing. Gonna keep pushing myself to make it happen.
Deborah: Keep it up, Jolene! Remember, the experience matters just as much as the end result. Step by step and have fun along the way. You can do it!
Jolene: Thanks for the boost!
