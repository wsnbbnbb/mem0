Deborah: Hey Jolene, since we talked I've been thinking about my mom's influence. Remembering those we love is important.
Jolene: I understand, Deb. Remembering and cherishing the memories of our loved ones is so important. It's comforting to know that their influence still guides us. Last Friday, my partner and I talked about how our loved ones have influenced us and what their values meant to us. It was an emotional chat, but it made us feel closer and showed us what really matters. 
Deborah: Those types of conversations really help build relationships. Can you tell me more about the values they have given you?
Jolene: Definitely! Our loved ones have taught us to persevere and stay resilient, like my mom always said to never give up, and my partner's dad showed them to stay determined. Their values have influenced us to pursue our goals, such as me with engineering and my partner with their creative endeavors. Even though they're not here, we both feel their values encouraging us along our paths.
Deborah: That's wonderful to hear, Jolene! It's amazing how their values continue to guide you, even in their absence. It sounds like you and your partner are honoring their memory by pursuing your respective passions. Have you ever considered incorporating those values into your work as well?
Jolene: Yeah, Deborah! We've been figuring out how to add these values into our projects. As an engineering student, I want to use my talents to do good and help solve important problems. I'm keen on coming up with new ideas and making things more efficient to make the world a better place. Going further, my mom stressed the value of helping others and that's something I want to keep in mind for my engineering projects.
Deborah: When our work ties into our values, it becomes more meaningful. What goals or ideas do you have for incorporating those values into your future projects?
Jolene: In the future, I'm aiming to work on projects that make a real difference to communities. I'm interested in sustainable initiatives and developing innovative solutions for environmental issues. I also want to get involved with organizations that focus on social causes, using my skills to help out. It's about connecting my passion for engineering with my commitment to making a positive impact.
Deborah: You've got a lot of amazing plans for the future. Which projects are you most interested in getting involved in?
Jolene: I'm keen on two projects in particular. One is focused on developing renewable energy, like solar, to help communities and reduce dependence on non-renewables. 
Deborah: Wow Jolene, that's really inspiring!
Jolene: The other is finding ways to supply clean water to those with limited access. Both align with my beliefs about sustainability and assisting those in need. I still have so much to figure out before beginning, but I'm up for the challenge.
Deborah: Sounds great, Jolene! Research is key to success. Little steps and being up for challenges make you stronger. I'm here for you. Connecting to yourself helps tackle any issue. Here's a photo that reminds me of the beauty of nature during a yoga session.
Jolene: It helps with challenges, giving balance and strength. Any tips for staying relaxed while studying?
Deborah: Taking breaks, doing some stretching/yoga, or just going for a walk is really helpful. And don't forget to get enough sleep and take time for self-care. Finding a balance between work and taking care of yourself is important. What self-care activities have you been doing lately?
Jolene: I've been into yoga and meditation lately. It helps me recharge. Doing different poses relieves tension and calms my mind. I've already shared my newfound love for yoga with my partner, and we're planning to go on a meditation retreat together to enhance our practice together.
Deborah: Glad to hear that yoga is helping you rest and recharge. It's great for reflection and self-care. Do your snakes also enjoy it?
Jolene: My snakes just like watching me chill. But she's a great company and always brings a sense of calm.
Deborah: Having a pet around is such a calming feeling. They sure can bring a great sense of comfort. I still have cats, Luna is sitting on the left.
Jolene: Aww, that's adorable! What's the second one's name?
Deborah: Max! They bring lots of joy and peace to our home.
Jolene: How did you get them?
Deborah: Max is my mother's cat, I took him when my mother passed away.
Jolene: You're great for taming him. How did you get Luna?
Deborah: I took Luna from the shelter.
Jolene: It’s wonderful that you have become their loving owner!
Deborah: Yes, I really love cats, and they also need a home, love, and care! Moreover, Max is already old, he is 8 years old.
Jolene: How old is Luna?
Deborah: She is younger, she is 5 years old.
Jolene: I am proud of your action to tame these pets!
