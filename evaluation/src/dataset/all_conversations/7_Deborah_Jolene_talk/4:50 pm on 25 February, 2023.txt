Jolene: Hi Deborah, it's been a while! Since we last talked, so much has happened. Balancing engineering school with my partner's video games is quite a feat. But I'm also setting aside time for myself, doing yoga and meditation. It helps give me calm amidst the craziness.
Deborah: Hey Jolene! Great to hear from you. Taking a break is key. How have those practices been helping with everything?
Jolene: They seriously saved me. I chill out and gain perspective when I do yoga. Afterward, I'm more alert and motivated. Here is my last photo.
Deborah: Wow, cool that yoga has been helping you out! Do they also do yoga with you? Does your partner do yoga with you?
Jolene: He started joining me sometimes, which is nice for bonding and relaxing. It's brought us closer. This is just our random photo.
Deborah: Aw, that's wonderful! How long have you been married?
Jolene: We're not married yet but we've been together for three years. We're taking it slow and loving the ride. This ring on his hand is just a decoration, not a wedding ring.
Deborah: Sounds nice, Jolene. Enjoying the journey is the main thing. So, how did you two meet?
Jolene: We actually met in an engineering class in college and quickly became friends. It eventually blossomed into something more and it's been great!
Deborah: Wow, your relationship started from a strong friendship. Do you still enjoy working on engineering projects together?
Jolene: Yep, teaming up for these projects feels great! We get each other's struggles and both love it.
Deborah: Have yoga or meditation helped with any stress?
Jolene: Whenever I'm overwhelmed, I just take a break and do some breathing or meditate. It really helps me feel calmer and clearer, so I'm able to handle challenges more easily.
Deborah: It's been great to see your progress since we last chatted - keep it up!
Jolene: Thanks, Deb! Your support really means a lot. I'm gonna keep pushing forward and continue taking time for myself.
Deborah:  Always rooting for you. Remember to listen to your heart and take good care. Here's a photo I took while reflecting outdoors. It's a reminder to find peace even in chaos.
Jolene:  I'm curious, what does your daily routine look like?
Deborah: In the morning, I meditate, do yoga, and teach classes. And yesterday I went for a morning jog for the first time in a nearby park. I will now incorporate this into my daily routine. And in the evenings, I spend time with loved ones.
Jolene: Why did you decide that?
Deborah: Exercise is key for me - it makes me feel connected to my body. 
Jolene: This is a great healthy habit!
Deborah: It's like they say - "Can't pour from an empty cup." Looking out for ourselves gives us the energy to help others. And don't forget, you're worth it too!
Jolene: Thanks, Deb. Your words really mean something to me. I'll keep remembering to prioritize self-care.
