Jolene: Hey Deborah, how's it going? Guess what? Yesterday my partner and I got back from an awesome trip to Rio de Janeiro- we checked out some cool yoga classes.
Deborah: That yoga pose looks great. Must've been a cool experience for the two of you. What did the trip teach you?
Jolene: This country was awesome! It showed me different kinds of yoga and their backgrounds, which made me appreciate it even more. We visited a lot of delicious cafes! Have you ever been somewhere that was important to you?
Deborah: Yep, last month I visited my mom`s house which holds a special place in my heart. My mom had good and bad times there, but it's still a symbol of her strength and the love she shared with me. This is my husband in front of this house.
Jolene: What was it like?
Deborah: It brought back fond memories as I relaxed outside.
Jolene: Sounds great! So glad you have a place to relax and find peace.
Deborah: Thanks, Jolene. It's special for me. How about you? Is there a place that helps you relax?
Jolene: I go to this nearby place to meditate by a tranquil spot.
Deborah: Looks chill. What's been the effect of that?
Jolene: It helps me make sense of everything and relieves stress. It's like a restart.
Deborah: Cool, glad you found a place to chill. We all need that occasionally. This is one of my favorite spots to ponder and let things go.

Jolene: Looks great! What made you pick that spot?
Deborah: The soothing vibes and nice views made it ideal for reflecting and letting go.
Jolene: Here is one more photo from Rio de Janeiro. We went on many excursions there.
Deborah: Wow, those stairs look cool! Where were they taken?
Jolene: We had a great time visiting an old temple. The stairs were amazing!
Deborah: Wow, exploring those temples must have been incredible! Three years ago I was also in Rio de Janeiro, I took a beautiful photo on one of the excursions.
Jolene: The architecture and history of it all were really interesting. I'm sure you also liked the places you visited there!
Deborah: Exploring historical places and learning their stories is so fun. It was a great experience. I want to share this photo with you.
Jolene:  By the way, what did that paper have written on it in the photo?
Deborah: This was written to me by a friend who, unfortunately, will never be able to support me. I miss him here. This quote says"Let go of what no longer serves you."
Jolene: I'm sorry! That's a good reminder to stay focused and let go of what no longer serves us. Remember the quote in my notebook? It also inspires me!
Deborah: What other quotes give you strength?
Jolene: I came across this one while browsing and it really hit home with me. It's a great reminder to ditch the negative stuff and focus on growing and being positive.
Deborah: Surrounding ourselves with good stuff and striving to improve is key.
Jolene: Yep, Deborah! It's about creating a good atmosphere to help us grow and improve. By the way, I have a new plant.
Deborah: What made you pick it?
Jolene: I got this as a reminder to nurture myself and embrace fresh starts.
Deborah: Nice job, Jolene! Take care of yourself and embrace new beginnings.
Jolene: Thanks Deb! Will do. Good talking to you. Take care!
Deborah: Have a great day!
