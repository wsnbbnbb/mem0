Deborah: Hey Jolene, had a tough week. Storm forced us to cancel our yoga getaway.
Jolene: Sorry to hear about it. How are you feeling now?
Deborah: I was bummed about it, but I'm doing better now. It was just a setback, but I found comfort in my work and spending time at home. Reminds me to be grateful for the little things. And you? How's it going?
Jolene: My partner and I plan a camping trip to connect with nature and practice yoga.
Deborah: It can be both good and tough to plan activities with a busy schedule - what strategies do you use?
Jolene: Having a routine helps me stay on top of everything I need to do. I have a schedule for classes, studying, and personal time. Self-care activities like yoga and meditation help me stay balanced and relax.
Deborah: I'd love to learn more about how you do it.
Jolene:  I can tell you about it if you're interested. It took a bit of experimenting, but it's really helped me.
Deborah: Sounds great! Let's set up a coffee date and talk about it!
Jolene: Wanna meet up at that cafe next Monday? Let's try fresh pastries.
Deborah: Sounds good, Jolene! When did you have in mind? That cafe rocks.
Jolene: How about Wednesday at 4? Can't wait to catch up over coffee!
Deborah: That pic looks so peaceful. Reminded me of a cool hidden coffee shop near me. Rate it!
Jolene: Tell me more about it when we meet, maybe next time we’ll be there.
Deborah: Sorry, I remembered that I already have plans for this day.
Jolene: Now I'll see when it's more convenient for me.
Deborah: Thank you for your understanding, I'm waiting.
Jolene: How about Friday at 5? I will need to sort out the books from this bookcase and I will be free.
Deborah: Absolutely, let's do that! Can't wait for our coffee date next week. See you then. Stay safe!
Jolene: See ya soon, Deb! Be safe and I'm excited for our coffee date!
Deborah: Maybe just grab me some interesting books!
