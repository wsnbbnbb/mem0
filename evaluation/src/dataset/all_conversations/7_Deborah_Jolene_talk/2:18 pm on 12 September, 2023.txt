Jolene: Hey Deb! So sorry for the late reply, been super busy. Last weekend my partner and I traveled to a meditation retreat for a few weeks in Phuket. Amazing experience! Nature, reflection and a break from engineering studies were awesome - it helped me find inner peace.
Deborah:  I'd love to hear more about your reflections there and how they changed you.
Jolene: At the retreat, I had time to reflect on what makes me happy. It made me realize the importance of incorporating relaxation, self-care, and balance in life alongside my engineering studies. The beauty of nature there was so inspiring and refreshing!
Deborah:  Was there anything from the retreat that stood out to you?
Jolene: The one session that really stood out was about releasing expectations and judgments and just savoring the present. It was a strong reminder to not just dwell on the finish line, but to appreciate the journey too. I usually get too consumed with hitting my goals that I forget to appreciate the ride.
Deborah:  I've been thinking about this a lot, too. Life's full of small moments and being grateful for those can really boost our happiness.
Jolene: Yup, totally agree! Sometimes we get too focused on the big stuff and don't appreciate all the tiny wins. Like the feeling of the sun or a great cup of coffee - can be small but they make life much better. Trying to be more mindful and grateful to take it all in now.
Deborah: That's great, Jolene! Practicing mindfulness and gratitude can really change our day-to-day. Even just a different outlook can make the little things in life joyful. Glad you're getting into it!
Jolene: I'm experiencing a new level of joy and happiness!
Deborah:  It's wonderful to see your progress, and I'm excited to be on this journey with you!
Jolene: Thanks, Deb! Appreciate your support. It's great that we can do this together.
Deborah: Having a supportive community definitely helps. We can motivate and encourage each other! By the way, I recently played a game. I don't remember what it's called. This is a card game about cats, where you take cards one by one from a deck, and then you can attack your opponent with them. We'll definitely play it with you!
Jolene: I look forward to meeting you and playing this game!
