Deborah: Hey Jolene, nice to meet you! How's your week going? Anything fun happened?
Jolene: Hi Deb! Good to meet you! Yeah, my week's been busy. I finished an electrical engineering project last week - took a lot of work, but it's done now. Anything fun happening for you?
Deborah: Congrats! Last week I visited a place that holds a lot of memories for me. It was my mother`s old house.
Jolene: Why does it hold such special memories for you?
Deborah: It was full of memories, she passed away a few years ago. This is our last photo together.
Jolene: Sorry about your loss, Deb. My mother also passed away last year. This is my room in her house, I also have many memories there. Is there anything special about it you remember?
Deborah: My mom's house had a special bench near the window. She loved to sit there every morning and take in the view. I come to sit here sometimes, it helps me stay connected to her.
Jolene: Staying connected is super important. Do you have something to remember her by? This pendant reminds me of my mother, she gave it to me in 2010  in Paris.
Deborah: Yes, I also have a pendant that reminds me of my mother. And what is special for you about your jewelry?
Jolene: It has a special symbol on it that represents freedom for me. It's a nice reminder to go for my goals and not get held back.
Deborah: It should really give you strength and energy!
Jolene: Do you have goals?
Deborah: One of my goals is to keep teaching yoga and supporting my community. I'm passionate about helping people find peace and joy through it.
Jolene: What inspired you to go down this route?
Deborah: Yoga helped me find peace during a rough time, and now I'm passionate about sharing that with others.
Jolene: It is truly inspiring!
Deborah: Gotta run, bye!
Jolene: Looking forward to the next chat!
