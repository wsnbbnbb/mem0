Deborah: Since speaking last, I reconnected with my mom's old friends. Their stories made me tear up and reminded me how lucky I am to have had her.
Jolene:  It's great that you could reconnect with them. Hearing stories about our loved ones can be tough but also comforting.
Deborah: Hearing stories about my mom was emotional. It was both happy and sad to hear things I hadn't heard before. It was a mix of emotions, but overall it was comforting to reconnect with her friends.
Jolene: It can bring up a range of emotions, and it's okay to feel a mix of happiness and sadness. Those moments with her friends must've been meaningful to you.
Deborah: Wow, it was so special. A glimpse into her life beyond what I knew. Through their eyes, I appreciate her more. Here I am and my mom.
Jolene: That looks like a blast! What did you and your mom's friends do on that day?
Deborah: We reminisced and looked through her photos. It was really sweet.
Jolene: Looking at old photos must have been so nostalgic! It's great that you could share that experience with friends. It's amazing how photos and memories can give us a deeper appreciation for the people we love.
Deborah: Pictures really have a way of bringing back memories and making us appreciate the special bond we have with our loved ones. They remind me of how strong love is and how amazing human relationships can be. Just like this one.
Jolene: Wow, what a gorgeous pic! Do you have any special memories of that beach or just love surfing in general?
Deborah: That beach is super special to me. It's where I got married and discovered my love for surfing. It's always filled with joy and peace.
Jolene: What pleasant memories.
Deborah: Here is another photo from my classes.
Jolene: Wow, that yoga pose looks amazing! Does it help you relax?
Deborah: Oh yeah! Doing this on the beach is so peaceful - the ocean, sand, and fresh air create a super relaxing atmosphere. The perfect way to take care of myself.
Jolene:  I like to create my own serene yoga space with candles and oils for extra chill vibes. Also, we tried a new style of meditation in Thailand - with flowers.
Deborah: Oh, same for me!
Jolene: I find calm when I do yoga or meditate. I use essential oils and put on some soft, soothing music in the background to create a peaceful atmosphere. It really helps me chill out and center myself.
Deborah:  It's amazing how our environment can enhance our practice.
Jolene: Yeah, totally! Our surroundings can really affect our mood and how much zen we can get from our routine. Creating a place that feels safe and chill is key.
Deborah: Wow, that looks so comfy and inviting! Where do you usually go to relax in your house?
Jolene: In my room, I usually go to relax and feel at ease. After a busy day, it's my little haven for peace and rest - the perfect spot to relax and recharge.
Deborah: Sounds like your room does the job. That's awesome.
Jolene:  Here are my pals keeping me company.
Deborah: Hey, that's Susie or Seraphim? How long has he been hanging out with you?
Jolene: It`s Susie! I've had her for two years now. 
Deborah: It's awesome how pets can bring us comfort and peace when we need it.
Jolene: Susie is a great companion.
Deborah: The love pets give is priceless.
Jolene: Plus, they make life a lot brighter!
