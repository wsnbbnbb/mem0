Jolene: Hey Deborah! Long time no talk - I had lots of stuff going on. Remember the tough engineering project? I finally wrapped that up last month. Look at the result!
Deborah: Jolene! Congrats on wrapping up your with it! You really put in the work and it paid off. 
Jolene:  I'm really proud of myself for sticking it out despite the problems and finishing it. It's definitely a big milestone.
Deborah: Now that you've reached this big milestone, what do you have planned next?
Jolene:  I'm interning at a well-known engineering firm. It's been a great opportunity to test my skills and gain real-world experience. These are my new colleagues!
Deborah: What's been the best part of it so far?
Jolene: The best part so far has been being able to apply what I learned in school to real projects. It's so fulfilling to see my ideas come to life.
Deborah: Mind if I ask how the internship has impacted you?
Jolene: It has had a positive impact on my life. It has stoked my love of engineering and has encouraged me to keep striving for my dreams.
Deborah:  How has it inspired you to keep striving for your dreams?
Jolene: Hanging out with people who love what they do has really inspired me to stay focused and keep working towards my goals. It's shown me that with dedication and effort, anything is possible.
Deborah: Have you been able to find a good work-life balance during your internship?
Jolene: Honestly, finding that balance has been tough. I've been slogging away and it's been hard to make time for my hobbies and chilling out.
Deborah:  Have you considered taking some breaks and finding activities like yoga to help you relax and unwind? That might make a difference.
Jolene: Yeah, I`m trying to do it. Here's an example of how I spent yesterday morning, yoga on top of mount Talkeetna.
Deborah: Nice job, Jolene! How long have you been doing yoga and meditation? It looks like it's really helping you regroup and recharge.
Jolene: I've been doing them sporadically for about 3 years now and they've had a real positive effect on me.
Deborah: Has it benefited you in any way? Have you found it helpful in difficult moments?
Jolene: It has helped me with stress and kept me centered.
Deborah: Glad they've been helpful for you!
Jolene: No idea how I would've survived without them!
Deborah: This is my favorite studio and it's always so calming. 
Jolene:  I was wondering if you have any advice on calming the mind and breathing during yoga?
Deborah: I'd recommend practicing mindful breathing for yoga. Set aside a few minutes each day to sit with your eyes closed, take deep breaths, and focus on how the air feels entering and leaving your body. 
Jolene: Thanks, Deborah! I'll definitely give it a try. Appreciate the advice!
Deborah:  If you need more tips or help, just let me know. Take care!
Jolene: See you!
