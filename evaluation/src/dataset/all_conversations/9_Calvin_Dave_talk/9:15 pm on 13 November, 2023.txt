Calvin: Hey Dave, I invited my old high school buddy to see me perform in Boston! It was insane. It got me thinking about how far I've come and reminded me how important relationships are in this biz. Felt so good!
Dave: Whoa, that's great Calvin! Seeing your old friend must have brought back so many memories. It's awesome to have someone who's been there since the start to support us.
Calvin: Remembering those days made me so nostalgic! Freestyling and talking about getting famous, it's crazy how life has changed. But being around certain people still sparks those same feelings. Take a look at how we freestyled when we were teenagers!
Dave: Wow, that's a great pic! Did that person make a big difference during your trip?
Calvin: He's been such a great friend to me. Always there to support and encourage me. His positivity has made a big difference in my journey.
Dave: It's great how someone's support and encouragement can really shape our lives! They give us the motivation to keep going and trust ourselves. Do you also find having supportive people around you important for your artist development?
Calvin: Having supportive people is key for me to grow as an artist. They motivate me to get better and stay true to myself. Having support is vital, especially in this tough music industry. Take a look at this photo!
Dave: Wow, Calvin! Is this a pic of some musicians you're collaborating with?
Calvin: Yeah, I've been supporting some young musicians from a music program. Supporting their passion is amazing and their enthusiasm is inspiring.
Dave: Wow, Calvin, that's amazing! You're really making a difference by supporting the next generation of musicians. It's great to nurture their passion and help them thrive.
Calvin: Thanks, Dave! It's like a torch being passed to keep music alive! These young musicians are very ambitious, I think I will support them for a long time.	
Dave: Yeah, Calvin! Your support for them keeps the music going and passes on the legacy. That's so awesome!
Calvin: I'm stoked I made a difference. Paying it forward, ya know? Working with new talent brings new ideas to this. Look at this photo, here's how I'm making a beat for a young artist, he has great potential in music! 
Dave: Wow, that's cool! Your music studio looks great. Have you tried out any new ideas lately?
Calvin: Thanks! I'm having fun trying out new sounds and pushing the boundaries. It's great to go for new ideas and see where it takes me - always gotta stay ahead in this.
Dave: Awesome, Calvin! Experimenting and pushing boundaries is key to making our art grow. Can't wait to see where these new ideas take you!
