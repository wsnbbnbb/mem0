Calvin: Hey Dave, been a few days, so I wanted to let you in on some cool news.  I just got a new car and it's amazing! Finally owning a luxury car was a dream come true and I'm so stoked.
Dave: Woohoo, Calvin! Congrats on the new car! How's it driving?
Calvin: Nice car! It's an amazing ride - super smooth and real powerful. Like a rockstar behind the wheel! Thanks, man!
Dave: Wow, Calvin! Owning something like this must feel amazing. Is this your first one? Show me a pic! What's it called?
Calvin: Woohoo! I finally got myself this beauty. Here's a pic from yesterday when I took it for a ride. Can't believe I'm actually driving it. Definitely what I deserve after all this hard work. Every time I step in, it's like an adrenaline rush!
Dave: Calvin, that car looks awesome! You must feel amazing every time you get inside! You deserved it - congrats buddy!
Calvin: Woah, I'm on cloud nine! Hard work pays off. What's up with you, Dave?
Dave: Thanks, Calvin! Doing good. Last weekend, I went to a music festival in Boston - it was awesome! So many cool bands playing and the atmosphere was electric. I love music, it reminded me why I love it. Here's a pic, take a look.
Calvin: Wow, sounds like a blast! Which one was your favorite?
Dave: Wow, there were so many great bands! If I had to pick a favorite, it would definitely be Aerosmith. Their performance was incredible. I'll show you a pic I took when they were playing.
Calvin: Cool! Lovin' Aerosmith.
Dave: I finally saw them live and it was such an amazing experience! He was jamming out to one of their hits. Check out this epic picture of them!
Calvin: Cool, Dave! Seeing your favorite singers live must have been wild! Did you get a chance to hang out with them after the show?
Dave: Nah, didn't get to hang with them after the show, but seeing them live was cool enough. It's always a dream to see your favorites performing!
Calvin: Yeah, it's always a dream to see your favorites doing their thing! So glad you got to experience that.
Dave: Thanks, Calvin! Yeah, it was an incredible experience. So, anything new happening in your life?
