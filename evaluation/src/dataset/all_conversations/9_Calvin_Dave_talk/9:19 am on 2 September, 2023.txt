Dave: Hey Calvin! Been a while, what's up? I'm tied up with car stuff lately, yesterday I came back from San Francsico with some great insights and knowledge on car modification that I want to share with you! Changing things around, and giving an old car a new life - so satisfying!
Calvin: Hey Dave! Nice to hear from you. That's cool! I totally understand the satisfaction you get from fixing cars. It's like you're giving them new life.
Dave: Yeah, it's great fixing stuff up and seeing it turn out better. It's really rewarding and gives me a sense of purpose. Plus, it feels like I'm making a difference when I fix someone's car.
Calvin: Wow, you must feel great making a real difference in someone's life, like being their superhero!
Dave: Yeah, it's great! It feels really good to make a difference and see their relief when their car is fixed. Makes me proud!
Calvin: Wow, Dave, that's awesome! You should be really proud of yourself for bringing joy to others. I booked a flight ticket to Boston last week! I'm so excited about my upcoming trip to Boston. Look at this! See you soon, buddy!
Dave: Cool! Let me know when you're free and we can catch up in Boston.
Calvin: Yeah, for sure! I'll let you know when I'm in Boston. See you soon!
Dave: Looking forward to seeing you! Have a safe trip, see ya!
Calvin: Thanks, Dave! Gotta stay safe on the trip. Can't wait to see you there! I will contact you when I arrive. Goodbye!
