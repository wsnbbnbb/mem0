Calvin: Hi Dave! Nice to hear from you. Since last chat, some things have happened. I had a lil car accident last Friday, kinda upsetting but no one was hurt. I've been dealing with insurance and repairs - taking up a lot of time and energy. Look at this photo!
Dave: Sorry to hear about the car accident, Calvin. I'm glad to hear that nobody was hurt. Dealing with insurance and repairs can definitely be time-consuming and draining. Have you encountered any issues in the insurance process so far?
Calvin: Hey Dave, thanks for checking in! The insurance process was a hassle - it took forever and there was a ton of paperwork. But it's all sorted now, and I'm getting it fixed up. Can't wait to drive it again!
Dave: How long did it take to get everything sorted out? I'm glad it's all taken care of now!
Calvin: It only took a week to sort everything out. I was worried about the cost, but it wasn't too bad. Look at this photo from the auto repair shop. 
Dave: Cool! Glad it wasn't too expensive. Who are him?
Calvin: That's the mechanic. He knows the stuff and is doing his best to get my car running again.
Dave: That's great to hear! Skilled and knowledgeable people working on your car - are you feeling confident?
Calvin: Feeling way more confident and excited to show off my car! Trusting their expertise.
Dave: Great, Cal! It's awesome when you trust the people fixing it. Sounds like they're doing a great job. It'll be back to normal soon!
Calvin: Thanks, Dave! Excited to drive again. Appreciate your help! Look what a wonderful view from living room!
Dave: Wow, what an amazing view! Where is it? I haven't seen anything like that before!
Calvin: Thanks, Dave! It's from a small town in Japan. The view of the mountains is unbelievably stunning!
Dave: Wow! Did you get to that place yet?
Calvin: Nope, not yet! I haven't been there before, but it's on my to-do list for after my tour with Frank Ocean ends. Can't wait to see them in person! Look at that snowy peak.
Dave: Looks awesome! Have you ever tried skiing before? It looks like loads of fun!
Calvin: Haven't tried it before, but it does look like a lot of fun! I might give it a try once. So what's up with you, is anything new in your daily routine?
Dave: Yes, Cal! I recently joined a rock band and have been practicing guitar. Look at this photo – it's us, the guys! 
Calvin: Playing guitar in a rock band is awesome, Dave! It will bring you a lot of emotions.
Dave: Sounds good, Calvin! Good company and great music, lift the mood and bring a lot of positive emotions! I have to go now. I'll see you soon!
Calvin: Thanks, Dave! let's keep in touch, take care!
