Evan: Hey Sam, hope you're doing good. Wanted to share some amazing news - my partner is pregnant! We're so excited! It's been a while since we had a kiddo around.
Sam: Congrats, Ev! That's great news! Parenthood is so amazing. How are you feeling about it?
Evan: So excited and a bit nervous! It's been a while since I had a toddler around but I'm really looking forward to it. Parenthood is so rewarding. I still remember when my first child was born, the joy was amazing. Looking forward to witness the miracle of life and build more memories with my family!
Sam: Wow, you're gonna be an amazing parent! Treasure those memories, they're truly special.
Evan: Thanks Sam! Absolutely. Talking of memories, I want to show you this. It's a collage of some of our top family memories. Each photo has an amazing moment - birthdays, holidays, vacations - so good to look back and recall all the great times we had.
Sam: That's so lovely, Evan. Your family looks so happy. What's the story behind that sign in the center?
Evan: Oh, that one? It's from our trip to Banff. We have this sign in the frame that says 'Bring it on Home' - it's our family's motto, always reminding us of the importance of togetherness, no matter where we are.
Sam: That's really touching, Evan. It's important to have something that keeps the family bond strong.
Evan: Absolutely, Sam. My family means the world to me. They're my rock. I'm looking forward to expanding our family and creating even more beautiful memories.
Sam: That's wonderful to hear, Evan! It's clear how much you value your family. Are you thinking of any specific plans or events to add to that collage?
Evan: Thanks, Sam! Yeah, we're planning a big family reunion next summer. It's going to be a blast and a perfect opportunity to add to our collage.
Sam: Sounds fantastic! If you need any tips on organizing such a big event, just let me know. I'm always here to support and celebrate your family's milestones.
Evan: Thanks, Sam! Your support means a lot. I'll keep you updated. Take care, bye!
Sam: Take care, Evan! Can't wait to hear about it. Bye!
Evan: Bye Sam. I'll definitely keep you updated. Thanks for the kind words and support. Take care!
