Gina: Hey Jon! Long time no chat! How's the dance studio? Last week was wild, I got noticed by fashion editors and it's been amazing but kinda scary. Everything's exciting but it's a lot of pressure to keep going up!
Jon: Hey Gina! Congrats on the fashion editors reach-out, that's awesome! Dance practice has been fun and exhausting. I'm gonna stay determined and make my own path by going full-time with my biz idea.
Gina: Just remember that sometimes stumbling blocks can be opened doors. Keep going!
Jon: Thanks! Your support and encouragement means a lot. Losing my job was a bummer, but it pushed me to take the plunge and go for my biz dreams. Started to learn all these marketing and analytics tools to push the biz forward today. It's been tricky, but I'm up for the challenge and I'm gonna make this work!
