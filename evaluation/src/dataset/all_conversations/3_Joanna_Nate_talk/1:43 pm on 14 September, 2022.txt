Joanna: Hey Nate, long time no see! My laptop crashed last week and I lost all my work - super frustrating! As a writer, my laptop is like half of my lifeline so losing all progress was like a major blow.
Nate: Hey Joanna, sorry to hear about that. Losing so much progress must be really frustrating. Did you manage to recover anything? Maybe consider backing up your work in the future?
Joanna: Thanks for the sympathy, Nate. Nothing was recoverable, but now I have an external drive for backups. I never want to go through this again. So, how have you been? Making anything cool?
Nate: Hey Joanna, I'm no writer like you, but something pretty awesome happened. Last Monday I got to teach people vegan ice cream recipes on my own cooking show! It was a bit nerve-wracking to put myself out there, but it was a blast. Plus, I picked up a few new recipes!
Joanna: Way to go, Nate! Congrats on the cooking show, I'll definitely be tuning in! What's your favorite dish from the show?
Nate: Coconut milk ice cream is at the top of my list. It's so smooth and creamy with a tropical coconut twist. Plus, it's dairy-free for people who can't have lactose or who want vegan options. Here's a snap of the ice cream I made.
Joanna: Wow, that looks amazing, Nate! I love the color and texture. It's great that you're making these options. Could you share the recipe? I'd love to try making it sometime!
Nate: Yeah sure! Would love to share it. Let's spread the joy of dairy-free options! Let me know when you make it!
Joanna: Cool, Nate! Gonna give it a go. Dairy-free is a must for me, especially for desserts. Last Friday, I made a deeeelish dessert with almond milk - it was good! Got any favs when it comes to dairy-free desserts?
Nate: Coconut milk ice cream is one of my favorites as you might be able to tell, but I also love a dairy-free chocolate mousse. It's super creamy and tastes like the real thing. What's been your favorite dairy-free sweet treat so far?
Joanna: Hey Nate, my favorite dairy-free treat is this amazing chocolate raspberry tart. It has an almond flour crust, chocolate ganache, and fresh raspberries - it's delicious!
Nate: That looks amazing, Joanna! I need to try baking that. What other treats do you like making?
Joanna: Hey Nate, I love making this dairy-free chocolate cake with raspberries. It's so moist and delicious - perfect sweetness level.
Nate: That cake looks amazing, Joanna! How did you make it?
Joanna: I make it with almond flour, coconut oil, chocolate and raspberries. It's my favorite for birthdays and special days.
Nate: Yum, Joanna! Gotta try that one. Any others you want to share?
Joanna: Hey Nate! Here's another recipe I like. It's a delicious dessert made with blueberries, coconut milk, and a gluten-free crust. So creamy and delicious!
Nate: Wow, Joanna! That dessert looks amazing. I'll definitely have to give it a try. Thanks!
Joanna: Glad to help, Nate. Let me know if you try it. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It was great chatting.
Nate: Thanks Joanna! I will. Bye!
