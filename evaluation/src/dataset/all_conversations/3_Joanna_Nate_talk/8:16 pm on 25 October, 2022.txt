Nate: Hey Joanna, what's been up since we last chatted? How's it going?
Joanna: Hey Nate! Another movie script that I contributed to was shown on the big screen last Sunday for the first time! It was such a surreal experience to see everything come together. I felt a mix of emotions, but overall, it was a satisfying moment. I've been waiting for this for a long time!
Nate: Congrats Joanna! How was it to finally see it on the big screen?

Joanna: It was an amazing experience! I'll never forget seeing all of the characters and dialogue I wrote being acted out - it was such a cool feeling. Having all the hard work and determination I put into writing pay off was definitely rewarding. I know this is the third time it's happened, but its just so awesome!
Nate: That must have been amazing. What was your favorite part of it?
Joanna: Seeing my characters I worked so hard on come alive was my favorite part. It felt like they jumped off the page and became real - it was totally surreal.
Nate: Wow Joanna, those drawings are really incredible! What inspired you to create them?
Joanna: Thanks, Nate! They're visuals of the characters to help bring them alive in my head so I can write better.
Nate: That's a cool way to gain insight into your characters. Where did you get your ideas for them?
Joanna: I got ideas from everywhere: people I know, stuff I saw, even what I imagined. It's cool to see how an idea takes shape into a person with their own wants, worries, and wishes.
Nate: Wow Joanna, that's so cool! It's amazing how our imaginations can bring ideas to life. Can you tell me more about the character on the left in the photo?
Joanna: Nope! You'll just have to watch the movie and find out for yourself!
Nate: You got it. I was already planning on watching it, but talking to you about it makes me want to watch it even more!
Joanna: Awesome! Well enough about me, what have you been up to?
Nate: I was bored today, so I just took my turtles out for a walk.
Joanna: Sound fun! Did they have a good time?
Nate: Of course! They look tired from all the walking, so they're relaxing in the tank right now.
Joanna: Aww, they're so cute! What do they eat?
Nate: They eat a combination of vegetables, fruits, and insects. They have a varied diet.
Joanna: Wow, that's fascinating! It's interesting how they have such a varied diet, including insects. Do you have a favorite among their food choices?
Nate: I love seeing them eat fruit - they get so hyped and it's so cute!
Joanna: Wow, that's so cute! They look like they really enjoy fruit.
Nate: Yeah, it's adorable! Watching them enjoy their favorite snacks is so fun. I also like holding them.
Joanna: Do they have different personalities, like the way dogs and cats do?
Nate: Yeah, they each do. One is more adventurous while the other is more reserved, which I find cute. Having them around brings me joy and they make great companions.
Joanna: That's super cool! I never knew turtles could be so interesting until I met your turtles. Wow!
Nate: I've always liked turtles since I was a boy, so I know all about them!
Joanna: You'll have to keep me posted on them! It's been fun chatting!
Nate: See you later Joanna!
