Joanna: Hey Nate! Yesterday was crazy cool - I wrote a few bits for a screenplay that appeared on the big screen yesterday! It was nerve-wracking but so inspiring to see my words come alive!
Nate: Congrats, Joanna! Seeing your hard work pay off like that must've felt amazing. I bet it was scary too, but awesome! You're so inspiring. By the way, last time we saw eachother, I noticed a spiderman pin on your purse. Is Spider-Man your favorite superhero, or do you have another fave?
Joanna: Thanks, Nate! It was a real roller coaster, but seeing the hard work pay off was amazing. Spider-Man has always been a favorite of mine - I mean, who doesn't love Peter Parker's struggles between being a hero and being a person? But I'm kind of a sucker for any superhero - everyone has their own rad story and powers. Do you have a favorite superhero?
Nate: That's great, Joanna! Iron Man is my top pick. I love his tech and that sarcastic humor. Seeing these figures just makes me feel invincible!
Joanna: Wow, Nate! That's awesome. I love the tech and funny jokes of Iron Man too. What made you get that figure?
Nate: Thanks Joanna! I got it because it reminded me of something I love. Its presence in my room is a good reminder to keep working on my goals. Any inspiring things in your room?
Joanna: My cork board is full of inspiring quotes and pictures for motivation and creativity. It's my little corner of inspiration.
Nate: Wow Joanna, that sounds great! Could you show me a picture of it?
Joanna: Here ya go, a pic of my cork board. It's got quotes, photos, and little keepsakes.
Nate: That's a great pic of your family! What made you hang it on your cork board?
Joanna: Thanks, Nate! Having that picture on my cork board reminds me of the love and encouragement from them every day.
Nate: That's great, Joanna. Family support is invaluable. It's so good to have those reminders.
Joanna: Absolutely, it means a lot and keeps me going.
Nate: I really should start a cork board of my own shouldn't I. That seems like a really valuable thing!
Joanna: I would definitely recommend it! As long as your willing to explain what it is to your friends.
Nate: Of course! Well see you later Joanna!
Joanna: Bye Nate!
