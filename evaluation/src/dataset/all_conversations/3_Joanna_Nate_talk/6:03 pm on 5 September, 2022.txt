Nate: Hey Joanna! Long time no talk. So much has happened. Look how cute they are! Hanging with them has been a big help, especially recently. Speaking of which, I just had a letdown in a video game tourney - I didn't do too great, even though I tried. It was a setback, but I'm trying to stay positive.
Joanna: Hey Nate! Cute turtles! Bummer about the setback. Any positive vibes comin' your way? I just revised on of my old recipes and made this!
Nate: Hey Joanna, yeah it's a bummer that I didn't do well. But it's all part of the learning curve, you know? Also that looks super good! Anyways, how are you holding up?
Joanna: I'm doing OK, thanks. Just been tinkering with that recipe and a few others. It's helping me find some comfort and getting creative.
Nate: What else are you making? It's always satisfying to see the kind of things you do when your in one of those moods!
Joanna: Been tweaking a dessert recipe to make it yummier and more accessible.
Nate: Wow, that sounds great! What flavors are you experimenting with?
Joanna: Trying out different flavors like chocolate, raspberry, and coconut has been a blast!
Nate: Sounds delicious! Are you only trying dairy-free options?
Joanna: Yeah, since I'm lactose intolerant I'm trying out dairy-free options like coconut or almond milk instead. It's been a fun challenge seeing how to make yummy treats that suit everyone's diets. I even made these dairy-free chocolate coconut cupcakes with raspberry frosting.
Nate: Woah, those look great, Joanna! It's cool that you make desserts that work for everyone's diets. Do you have any more yummy recipes hiding in there?
Joanna: Yep! I've been making all sorts of desserts that work for everyone's diets - cookies, pies, cakes - everything! I'll share more recipes with you soon.
Nate: Can't wait to try them. Can I join you sometime? I think baking and cooking really brings us together!
Joanna: Yeah, Nate! A fellow Chef in the kitchen is always a great help! Speaking of which, i'm curious, any more tips for dairy-free baking?
Nate: You can use stuff like dairy-free margarine or coconut oil instead of butter, and make sure to check the labels to ensure they're dairy-free. Good luck!
Joanna: Thanks, Nate! Love your ideas, can't wait to try them out!
Nate: No problem! I love to help, so just shoot me a question anytime you need!
Joanna: Got it Nate, I'll see you soon!
Nate: Bye Joanna! Good luck!
