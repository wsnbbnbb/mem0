Tim: Hey John! How've you been? Something awesome happened - I'm writing articles about fantasy novels for an online mag. It's so rewarding!
John: Hey Tim! Congrats on the opportunity to write about what you're into! How did it happen?
Tim: Thanks! I found this opportunity on a fantasy lit forum and thought it'd be perfect since I love fantasy. I shared my ideas with the magazine and they liked them! It's been awesome to spread my love of fantasy.
John: Congratulations! That's awesome. What kind of articles have you been writing?
Tim: Thanks! I've been writing about different fantasy novels, studying characters, themes, and making book recommendations.
John: Awesome! Must be so rewarding to delve into your books and chat about them. Do you have any favorite books you love writing about?
Tim: For sure! Harry Potter and Game of Thrones are amazing - I'm totally hooked! I could chat about them forever!
John: Oh yeah, I remember you telling me about Harry Potter! I've got a funny story. Anthony and I went to this charity thing and ended up in this intense Harry Potter trivia contest. We did alright, but there was this one super-nerd there that took home this as a prize.

Tim: That looks great! The signature is sweet! Have you been reading anything?
John: I've been reading this inspiring book, it reminds me to keep dreaming.
Tim: Books can really inspire and help us keep our dreams alive. Keep it up!
John: Thanks! They really do. I want to keep reaching for new goals.
Tim: Same here!
John: Have fun with your writing! Catch you later!
Tim: Thanks! I'll enjoy writing them. Take care and talk soon!
