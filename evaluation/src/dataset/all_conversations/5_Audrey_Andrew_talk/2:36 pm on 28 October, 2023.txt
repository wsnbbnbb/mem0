Audrey: Hey Andrew, I wanted to let you know about something going on with my dogs. I noticed they weren't acting normally, so I made an appointment with an animal behaviorist last Wed. It's been a bit hectic but I'm hopeful it'll help me better understand them.
Andrew: Oh no! Sorry to hear that your dogs haven't been themselves. Are they doing ok? How did the appointment with the animal behaviorist go? Did you receive any helpful advice or insights?
Audrey: The appointment went okay. It was hectic at first, but the behaviorist checked them out and asked some questions. I got some tips to try and help with their problems now.
Andrew: So what tips did you get? What will you be doing to help with the problems?
Audrey: The behaviorist gave me tips on how to handle it and suggested some changes in their routine. I'm using positive reinforcement techniques and it's still a work in progress, but I'm hopeful it'll help.
Andrew: I'm glad your pups are still good with positive reinforcement! How are they doing with the new approach tho?
Audrey: So far they seem to be responding well to it! It won't be fixed immediately but I'm seeing some progress. Here's hoping it keeps going.
Andrew: That's good to hear! Keep up the good work!
Audrey: Thanks! Your words of encouragement really mean a lot. It's tough, but I'm devoted to keeping them healthy and happy - they mean everything to me.
Andrew: You're doing a great job! They're lucky to have you.
Audrey: Thanks! They're really special to me and I want the best for them. Here's a pic of them having a blast last summer, so happy! I'm looking forward the day they are back to normal.
Andrew: Aww, they're having such a blast! What kind are they? I'm wishing you and your pups the best. 
Audrey: Thanks! They're all mutts, but Pepper and Panda are Lab mixes, and Precious and Pixie are Chihuahua mixes. I really need that. I can't wait the day they're all back to normal.
Andrew: Sending prayers and wishes. Here's a pic I took at a national park I went a while ago.
Audrey: Wow, that looks gorgeous! We hope to join you and the furry friends soon!
Andrew: Yeah I really hope your pups can get better and join us soon!
Audrey: Wow, that trail looks nice! Looks like its dog friendly?
Andrew: Yup! It's close by and it's dog-friendly too, with killer views. Wanna plan a hike soon?
Audrey: Hmmm sure! Let's pick a date and go hike. It should be good!
Andrew: Yay! Does Saturday sound good? We can grab some snacks and have a blast exploring. Because on Sunday I am going on a picnic date with my girlfriend.
Audrey: Saturday works for me! I'm going to bring some snack. Super excited!
Andrew: Can't wait for our nature day with the fur babies! We're gonna have a good time!
Audrey: Going hiking and seeing nature will be awesome. They'll be so happy!
Andrew: I bet! Where do you guys plan to explore?
Audrey: Let's check out the trail first. It's a peaceful spot to bring the fur babies for the day.
Andrew: Sounds great! There's a lake near the trail too! It's gonna be awesome!
Audrey: Oh nice! Can't wait to explore it and hang out with our furry friends. Should be a peaceful day! Here's a photo of the lake I found online.
Andrew: Wow, that looks awesome! Do you think the dogs will like it? Which trail do you have in mind?
Audrey: Let's try that trail by the lake with great views, perfect for us and the pups. Should be fun!
Andrew: Sounds great! They will love it by the lake. Can't wait!
Audrey: Gonna be great - nature, furry pals - what more could we want? I'm so lucky to have a friend like you who loves exploring and being outside with our dogs.
Andrew: Same! I'm lucky to have a friend like you for these outdoor trips. It's awesome to be out in nature with our furry friends.
Audrey: Yup! It's hard to find someone that has similar thoughts. 
Andrew: Exactly! Oh btw, here's another photo of a trail near the location. What do you think?
Audrey: That looks pretty good! I'd love to take them there sometime.
Andrew: How about going there the next trip? The autumn colors are so beautiful!
