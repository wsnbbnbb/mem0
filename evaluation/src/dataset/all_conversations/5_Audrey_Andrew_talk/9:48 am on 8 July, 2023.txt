Andrew: Hey how's it going? Last Friday was amazing - I had a picnic with my girlfriend and it was so much fun! Being in the nature can be so refreshing and it always brings me joy. 
Audrey: Wow sounds like the picnic was awesome! Yeah being in the nature is so nice. My furry friends always make me happy. We had a great walk the other day - felt really good!
Andrew: That's awesome! Dogs really make life more fun doesn't it. I wish I could get one, but like I said, it's tough to find a place and find the right dog. How did you get yours?
Audrey: Thanks! I got lucky finding a breeder nearby that has the dogs I wanted. Yeah places that allows dogs are really hard to find unfortunately .
Andrew: Yeah it's tough. I found a few parks where you can take your pup on a leash, but it's not the same as having an open area where they can run and play. If I find something, I'll let you know. 
Audrey: Cool, I should join you for a hike and bring my dogs. It would be great to have a chance where they can run freely.
Andrew: Yeah definitely ! I'm down for a hike with you and your furry friends. Let's do it next month when the weather is more pleasant. Here's the trail that I think it'd be great for the dogs.
Audrey: That'd be awesome! I can't wait to take them hiking. Fingers crossed we find a spot with a great view and lots of room for them to explore and have a blast.
Andrew: Looking forward to seeing them have fun hiking. Let's get planning for next month! Here's the map for the trail.
Audrey: Yep! I'm gonna look into the trail for my furry friend to run around.
Andrew: Sounds good! Let's make sure the trail is safe for the dogs to run around and have fun.
Audrey: Yep! After all safety is top priority when the dogs are outside running around.
Andrew: Agreed! It's going to be a great with the dogs!
Audrey: Yup! Btw, there's going to be some cool stuff happening today.
Andrew: Woah! They look so cute! What is going on here? They look ready for an adventure.
Audrey: Haha yeah! They're all set for their next outdoor adventure!
Andrew: Aw man, can't wait to meet them! They seem like a blast!
Audrey: Yeah, they definitely do! They really are a lot of fun.
Andrew: Oh I'm sure, dogs definitely add lots of fun to our daily life.
Audrey: Yep! They bring me so much joy. Can't get bored at all.
Andrew: Aww, they look adorable playing in the park! Seeing them have so much fun must be so rewarding.
Audrey: Yeah it sure does. Seeing them so happy and bouncy makes me really happy.

Andrew: Aww look at them, so cute! It'll definitely be a great day! I love being outdoors and seeing others enjoy it too.
Audrey: Yeah! Being outside and seeing people happy is awesome. Here's a pic from a hike last year. Such a pretty sunset!
Andrew: Wow, that's stunning! Mind telling me where this is? 
Audrey: I hiked this last year! It was a 3 hour drive from me and the sunset was amazing!
