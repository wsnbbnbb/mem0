John: Hey Maria, I've been busy doing the petition I started - it's tricky but it's been cool getting back in touch with my buddies and gaining support. I got this picture of my workmates when we went on a hiking trip, they really make me keep going! What have you been up to? Anything new with your charity?
Maria: Hey John! Cool that it's going well - you and your friends look like a great team! I'm busy at the shelter getting ready for a fundraiser next week. Hopefully, I can raise enough to cover basic needs for the homeless.
John: Wow, Maria! Raising money is crucial for those in need. Is there any way I can help out with your fundraiser?
Maria: Thanks, John! Appreciate your help. We need to get the word out about the chili cook-off at the fundraiser. Here's the poster!
John: Wow, it looks awesome! I'll make sure to spread the word about it. Is there anything else I can do to assist?
Maria: Thanks, John! Your help is really appreciated. If you know anyone who might be interested in volunteering for the event, let me know. We can do this!
John: Yep, Maria! I'll ask around to see if anyone I know wants to help. We'll find some awesome people for the cause. Let's make a change!
Maria: Way to go, John! Let's help those in need. Thanks for your support!
John: No problem, Maria! Working together with passionate people like you is awesome! Let's make a difference.
