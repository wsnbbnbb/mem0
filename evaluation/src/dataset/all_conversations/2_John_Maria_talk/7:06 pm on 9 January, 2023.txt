Maria: Hey John, great news - I'm now friends with one of my fellow volunteers! We both love helping others. How have you been since we last chatted?
John: Hey Maria, I've been busy with work and family, but last week I had an unexpected incident on my way home. It reminded me how life can throw unexpected troubles our way.
Maria: Oh John, that sounds tough. I'm glad you're alright. Life does throw us some surprises, doesn't it?


John: Thanks, Maria. This is a reminder to stay strong during tough times.
Maria: Yeah John, when stuff like that happens, it's good to tap into our own inner strength. How did you handle it?
John: I tried to stay calm and asked for assistance, which helped me handle the situation and make it back safely.
Maria: Hey, John that's awesome! You really showed your resilience and resourcefulness. How did you feel afterwards?
John: I felt relieved and grateful to make it through without incident.
Maria: Yeah, it's tough. Appreciate what you've got. You got through it - stay strong. Are there any things you like to do to calm down during times like this?
