John: Hey Maria, hope you're doing OK. I had to share something cool with you - I asked family and friends to join the virtual support group I am a part of and be advocates for the military. It's been awesome seeing so many people coming together to back the courageous people serving our nation.
Maria: Wow, John! Way to go helping veterans! I'm doing my part too, volunteering at a homeless shelter. It's so rewarding.
John: Maria, that's great! That picture shows a lot of joy. What got you started at that place?
Maria: I started volunteering here about a year ago after witnessing a family struggling on the streets. It made me want to help, so I reached out to the shelter and asked if they needed any volunteers. They said yes, and it has been a really fulfilling experience for me since then.
John: Wow, Maria! You really made an impact – it's awesome! I seriously admire what you do.
Maria: Thanks John. That really means a lot. It's been tough but knowing I can make a difference keeps me motivated.
John: Maria, what's the deal with that note? Who wrote it and what does it say?
Maria: One of the residents at the shelter, Cindy, wrote it. It's a heartfelt expression of gratitude and shows the impact of the support they receive.
John: Wow, Maria, that's so cool that you're making a difference like that! You're so inspiring. Last week, we had a meaningful experience at a military memorial. It really made an impact on my kids.
Maria: That's so moving! How did they react when they saw it?
John: They were awestruck and humbled.
Maria: Imagining visiting a military memorial makes me feel humble too. It's important for younger generations to remember and appreciate those who served.
John: Yeah, totally! Showing them how to respect and appreciate those who served our country is important. It was a moving experience for all of us.
Maria: Yeah John, it's super important to teach kids about veterans and what they did for us. You're doing a great thing - we need more people like you!
John: Thanks, Maria. Appreciate your support. It's amazing what teamwork can accomplish!
Maria: Yeah, we can really get amazing stuff done together. We can do this!
